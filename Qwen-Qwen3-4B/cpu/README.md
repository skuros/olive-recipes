# Qwen-Qwen3-4B — CPU optimization

This folder contains Olive recipes for optimizing Qwen-Qwen3-4B targeting the CPU EP.

## What this folder is for

- Execution Provider: CPU EP
- Typical precision: INT4 precision by default
- Example recipe filename: Qwen-Qwen3-4B_cpu_int4_kld_gradient.json

## Setup

1) Install the main branch of Olive:
   - pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/olive.git
2) Install the required runtime and dataset packages for this backend:
   - onnxruntime-genai (CPU build)
   - datasets
   - transformers==4.52.4
   - accelerate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
3) Run Olive to build/optimize the model
   - olive run --config Qwen-Qwen3-4B_cpu_int4_kld_gradient.json

Additional notes:
- Optional: Use best practices when considering accuracy vs. memory to improve throughput on CPU.
- Runs purely on CPU; no GPU required.
